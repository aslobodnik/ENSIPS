# Ethereum Name Service Improvement Proposals (ENSIPs)

The goal of the ENSIP project is to standardize and provide high-quality documentation for ENS itself and conventions built upon it. This repository tracks past and ongoing improvements to ENS in the form of Ethereum Name Service Improvement Proposals (ENSIPs). [ENSIP-?](ENSIPS/ensip-D10-001) governs how ENSIPs are published.


**Before you write an ENSIP, ideas MUST be thoroughly discussed on the [ENS DAO Forum](https://discuss.ens.domains/). Once consensus is reached, thoroughly read and review [ENSIP-?](ENSIPS/ensip-D10-001), which describes the ENSIP process.**

Please note that this repository is for documenting standards and not for help implementing them. These types of inquiries should be directed to the ENS developers Discrod channel, or [ENS DAO forum](https://discuss.ens.domains/). For specific questions and concerns regarding ENSIPs, it's best to comment on the relevant discussion thread of the ENSIP denoted by the `discussions-to` tag in the ENSIP's preamble.

If you would like to become an ENSIP Editor, please contact a current ENSIP Editor. The list of editors can be found on [ENSIP-?](ENSIPS/ensip-D10-001).
